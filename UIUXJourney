My first experience learning UI/UX is when i joined a mini bootcamp organized by skilvul 
at that time i learn how to use figma properly when designing landing page
second i try to learn UI/UX by joining a online class, i learned detailed UI/UX specification
and then i learn about UX, UX is fun ! 
So i started to learn web development now
